Financial Stock Portfolio Risk and Return Analysis
Introduction
This project analyzes the risk and return of a financial stock portfolio using data science techniques. It incorporates clustering for asset selection, portfolio optimization, and stock price forecasting using ARIMA models. The analysis is performed on stocks from the NIFTY50 and S&P500 indexes, providing insights into asset selection and risk management.

Features and Methodologies
1. Data Fetching
Historical stock price data is retrieved using the yfinance library.
Includes individual stocks (e.g., Apple Inc. from 2016-2019) and index data (NIFTY50 & S&P500 from 2019-2023).
2. Data Preprocessing
Extracts relevant stock price data, storing it in CSV files for further analysis.
Computes daily returns using percentage changes in stock prices.
3. Data Visualization
Uses matplotlib to visualize historical adjusted close prices and trends.
Plots risk-return graphs to analyze portfolio performance.
4. K-Means Clustering for Asset Selection
Groups stocks based on historical returns and volatilities to identify optimal selections.
Helps diversify the portfolio by classifying stocks with similar risk profiles.
5. Portfolio Optimization
Uses mathematical optimization to determine the optimal asset weights.
Balances risk and return using a mean-variance optimization approach.
Applies optimization techniques to both NIFTY50 and S&P500 stocks.
6. ARIMA Model for Stock Price Forecasting
Splits historical stock data into training and testing sets.
Fits an ARIMA model to predict future stock prices.
Evaluates forecast accuracy using statistical performance metrics.
Uses forecasted prices to simulate future portfolio returns.
